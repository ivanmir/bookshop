The CSDL objects are used to feed the corresponding EDM objects. They are returned from the application by using a EdmProvider.

Using the CSDL objects is not mandatory, but a application will profit from some convenience methods to easily fill a EDM. Of course a EDM can also filled with using ad hok created JSON objects ( e.g. { ... }) providing the same attributes as the CSDL objects. A possible use case may be to store this objects on disc as JSON file if creating is slow ( e.g. backend data required).
